## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* go-credentials has a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests and the quality gate. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
* Before adding new features, please think about whether they are suitable in a "credentials" context. 

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/engi-fyi/go-credentials/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/engi-fyi/go-credentials/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new feature or major revision, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

### Security Updates
If you have a security update to contribute, please submit a PR for all supported `release/` branches. This helps us to coordinate the release of these fixes.

## Style guide
Please see our [coding standards](https://go-credentials.engi.fyi/coding_standards) to ensure your code, test format, and naming scheme matches the rest of our repository.

## Setting up your environment

You will only need Go 1.13 to run go-credentials.

## Community

Any discussion about go-credentials takes place on this repository's [Issues](https://github.com/engi-fyi/go-credentials/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/engi-fyi/go-credentials/pulls) sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation. The one exception to this is for security vulnerabilities (see [Security Policy](https://github.com/engi-fyi/go-credentials/security/policy).

## Thanks
Thanks to the [opensource.guide](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide) community, as this CONTRIBUTING document was borrowed heavily from their repository.
