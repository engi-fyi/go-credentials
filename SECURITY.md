## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in `go-credentials`, please submit a __Bug report__ or preferably, email security@engi.fyi and the bug will be actioned within 72 hours. Alternately, feel free to submit a PR with code changes to resolve the issue and we will endeavour to merge it within 24 hours.

## Other

We have security scanning enabled on this repository using https://github.com/securego/gosec. As a note, we have rule G101 disabled as we have hardcoded strings for test vars.
